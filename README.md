# Real-Time Car and License Plate Detection System

## Overview

Welcome to the Real-Time Car and License Plate Detection System! This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect cars and license plates in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Detects cars and license plates in live video streams.
- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes state-of-the-art models for accurate detection.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple setup and usage instructions.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paull-o/Real-Time-Car-and-Licence-Plate-Detection-System.git
cd Real-Time-Car-and-Licence-Plate-Detection-System
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Usage

To run the detection script, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --video path/to/video.mp4
```
Replace path/to/video.mp4 with the path to your video file.
